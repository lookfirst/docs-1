  whatsAUnikraft: What's a unikernel?
  leading: Unikraft is a fast, secure and open-source Unikernel Development Kit
  subtext: By tailoring the operating system, libraries and configuration to the particular needs of your application, it vastly reduces virtual machine and container image sizes to a few KBs, drastically cutting down your software stack's attack surface.

blazingFast:
  feature: Blazing Fast
  header: Unikraft is faster than Linux
  leader: On Unikraft, NGINX is 166% faster than on Linux and 182% faster than on Docker
  left: <strong>Unikraft out performs even well-configured custom Linux kernel images</strong>, even those with security mitigations turned off!  Compared to other Unikernel Development Kits, library OSes and containers, Unikraft still out performs.
  right: We benchmarked NGINX throughput by throttling requests to the same payload size on other unikernels, Linux and Docker and demonstrate 182% performance improvement against the traditional containerization method Docker.
  callToAction: Unikraft has been extensively and carefully benchmarked, <a class=" font-medium text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="/docs/features/performance">read more about performance &rarr;</a>
